- [ ] [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/): containerise and deploy
- [ ] [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs): tracing, cost and latency per request
- [ ] [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/): prompt injection, secrets, rate limits
- [ ] [PEFT / LoRA](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft): fine-tune vs RAG vs prompting

## Where things go

- Your work: `06-production/<your-github-username>/`
- Anything more than one of you reuses: `shared/` + a test in `tests/`
