# Software architecture

AI Engineering Arena is a single-page web app (React + TypeScript, served by GitHub Pages) on top of a Supabase backend (Postgres with row-level security, realtime and GitHub sign-in). Python and AI models run **in the browser**, in Web Workers. Nothing costs money to run.

The frontend follows an **AUTOSAR-style layered architecture**:
- **Application software components (SWC)** never talk to infrastructure directly.
- They go through a **runtime environment (RTE)** of typed ports.
- The ports are implemented by the **basic software (BSW)**.

The same idea is applied to the database ([database.md](database.md)).

## 1. System context

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  player([Player<br/>GitHub account])
  admin([Admin<br/>TWadi, Ghassen])
  visitor([Visitor])
  arena[AI Engineering Arena<br/>web app]
  github[(GitHub<br/>OAuth sign-in)]
  hf[(Hugging Face<br/>model files)]
  cdn[(jsDelivr<br/>Pyodide)]

  player -- learns, quizzes, duels, races --> arena
  admin -- lets players in --> arena
  visitor -- watches the board --> arena
  arena -- sign in --> github
  arena -- downloads models once --> hf
  arena -- downloads Python once --> cdn
```

## 2. Containers

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph browser[Player's browser]
    spa[Single-page app<br/>React + TypeScript]
    py[Python worker<br/>Pyodide]
    ai[AI workers<br/>transformers.js: embeddings, tokenizers, Qwen2.5 LLM]
    spa <--> py
    spa <--> ai
  end
  subgraph supabase[Supabase]
    auth[Auth<br/>GitHub OAuth]
    api[PostgREST API]
    rt[Realtime<br/>row changes + broadcast]
    db[(Postgres<br/>public = API, private = internals)]
    api --> db
    rt --> db
    auth --> db
  end
  pages[GitHub Pages<br/>static hosting]
  pages -- serves --> spa
  spa -- HTTPS + RLS --> api
  spa -- websocket --> rt
  spa -- OAuth --> auth
```

Every rule that matters runs in the database:
- Grading.
- The duel clock.
- Who may tick what.
- Who is an admin.

The browser can display results, but it can't fake them.

## 3. Frontend layers

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  app["app/ — composition root<br/>(ECU configuration)"]
  ui["swc/ui/ — components and pages"]
  logic["swc/logic/ — pure runnables<br/>rules, maths, domain types"]
  rte["rte/ — ports + hooks<br/>(runtime environment)"]
  bsw["bsw/ — basic software<br/>Supabase adapters, realtime, workers"]

  app --> ui
  app --> rte
  app --> bsw
  ui --> rte
  ui --> logic
  rte --> logic
  bsw -. implements .-> rte
  bsw --> logic
```

| Layer | Folder | Responsibility | May import |
|---|---|---|---|
| Composition root | `site/src/app/` | Builds the one `Rte` instance (`createRte()`) and mounts the app inside `<RteProvider>` | everything |
| Application components | `site/src/swc/ui/` | Pages and components; state via RTE hooks | `swc/logic`, `rte` |
| Runnables | `site/src/swc/logic/` | Pure rules: XP, levels, badges, duel views, quiz pass mark, routing, vector maths, domain types | nothing outside `swc/logic` (no React, no Supabase) |
| RTE | `site/src/rte/` | Port interfaces (`ports.ts`), `RteProvider`/`useRte`, hooks that turn ports into React state | `swc/logic` |
| Basic software | `site/src/bsw/` | Supabase adapters, realtime channels, offline ports, Pyodide and model workers | `swc/logic`, `rte` (to implement ports) |

## 4. The RTE: ports

All ports are defined in [`site/src/rte/ports.ts`](../site/src/rte/ports.ts). Like AUTOSAR ports, there are two kinds:

- **Sender/Receiver:** `load…()` returns the current value, and `watch…()` delivers changes pushed later (realtime). Each returns an `Unsubscribe`.
- **Client/Server:** operations returning `Outcome<T>`, which is either `{ ok: true, value }` or `{ ok: false, error }`. The error is already a message meant for the player; raw database errors never reach the UI.

| Port | Sender/Receiver | Client/Server | Implemented in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AuthPort` | session, own profile | sign in/out | `bsw/supabase/auth.ts` |
| `ProgressPort` | players, progress | `markDone` | `bsw/supabase/progress.ts` |
| `QuizPort` | results, quiz items | `start`, `submit` | `bsw/supabase/quizzes.ts` |
| `DuelPort` | duels, entries, race solutions | `create`, `createRace`, `respond`, `cancel`, `start`, `submit`, `submitRace`, `finish` | `bsw/supabase/duels.ts` |
| `LivePort` | live duel progress (broadcast, never stored) | `send` | `bsw/supabase/duels.ts` |
| `PlayersPort` | admin overview | `invite`, `remove`, `decline` | `bsw/supabase/players.ts` |
| `SolvesPort` | challenge solves | `record` | `bsw/supabase/solves.ts` |
| `PythonPort`, `KernelPort` | — | run challenge tests, run notebook cells | `bsw/compute/` (Pyodide workers) |
| `EmbedPort`, `TokenizerPort`, `LlmPort` | — | embed, tokenize, generate | `bsw/compute/` (transformers.js workers) |
| `LibraryPort` | personal notes, cached embeddings | save/delete notes, store vectors | `bsw/browser/library.ts` (IndexedDB, never uploaded) |

Without database settings, `createRte()` wires `bsw/offline.ts` instead: reads come back empty and every action explains why.

## 5. Key flows

### A live quiz duel

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant A as Wadi (DuelArena)
  participant RTE as RTE (useDuels / DuelPort)
  participant DB as Postgres (public API → private referee)
  participant B as Ghassen (DuelCenter)

  A->>RTE: create(item, Ghassen)
  RTE->>DB: create_duel() — picks 5 questions into private.duel_keys
  DB-->>B: realtime: duel pending → invite pop-up + notification
  B->>DB: respond_duel(accept) — starts_at = now + 5 s
  par both players
    A->>DB: start_duel() — countdown, then the questions
    B->>DB: start_duel()
  end
  A-->>B: LivePort broadcast: answered 3/5 (not stored)
  A->>DB: submit_duel(answers) — graded against private keys
  B->>DB: submit_duel(answers)
  DB->>DB: private.decide_duel() — winner, then each sheet becomes a quiz attempt
  DB->>DB: trigger: a pass (4/5) completes the lecture
  DB-->>A: realtime: done, scores, XP
  DB-->>B: realtime: done, scores, XP
```

### Ask the course (RAG in the browser)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as AskCourse
  participant H as useAskCourse (RTE)
  participant L as LibraryPort (IndexedDB)
  participant E as EmbedPort (MiniLM worker)
  participant M as LlmPort (Qwen2.5 worker)
  H->>L: load notes + cached vectors
  H->>E: embed only uncached chunks (lecture notes + your notes)
  H->>L: cache new vectors
  UI->>H: ask(question)
  opt follow-up with history (lesson #7)
    H->>M: rewrite into a standalone question
  end
  H->>E: embed the question
  H->>H: BM25 + cosine search, reciprocal rank fusion (swc/logic/ask)
  H->>M: grounded prompt with the top 4 chunks
  M-->>UI: streamed answer
  H->>H: post-hoc citations: each sentence matched to its best source
```

### Passing a quiz completes a lecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as QuizDialog
  participant RTE as useQuizzes / QuizPort
  participant DB as Postgres
  UI->>RTE: start(lecture)
  RTE->>DB: start_quiz() — 5 random questions, shuffled, no answers
  UI->>RTE: submit(answers)
  RTE->>DB: submit_quiz() — graded with private.quiz_keys
  DB->>DB: trigger private.complete_item_on_pass(): score ≥ 4/5 → progress row
  DB-->>UI: realtime: new progress + quiz result (box ticks itself)
```

## 6. How the rules are enforced

| Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Layer directions, no cycles, Supabase only in `bsw/`, no orphan modules | [`site/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`](../site/.dependency-cruiser.cjs) (`npm run lint:arch`), run in CI |
| Types are sound across layers | `tsc -b` (strict), run in CI |
| Database API surface is exactly the intended ports | [`supabase/tests/70_api_surface.sql`](../supabase/tests/70_api_surface.sql), run in CI |
| Every migration replays from scratch | `supabase/tests/run.sh`, run in CI |
| Coding challenges are solvable and their starters fail | `site/challenges/build.py`, run in CI |

A violation fails the pull request.

## 7. Testing strategy

| Level | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Unit (pure) | XP, levels, badges, duel views, feed, routing, vectors, share cards | `site/src/swc/logic/**/*.test.ts` |
| RTE with fake ports | hooks driven by in-memory ports, no database | `site/src/rte/rte.test.tsx` |
| Database | sign-up, security, quizzes and progress gating, duels, races, players, solves, API contract | `supabase/tests/*.sql` on a fresh Postgres 15 with a Supabase shim |
| Content | every coding challenge's reference solution passes and its starter fails | `site/challenges/build.py` |
| Python | `shared/` package | `tests/` (pytest) |

## 8. Adding a feature

1. **Rules first:** put the pure logic and its types in `swc/logic/`, with unit tests.
2. **Database:** if the feature needs the database, add a migration. Secrets and helpers go in `private`. Expose only what the site calls in `public`, and update `70_api_surface.sql` in the same PR. Add SQL tests.
3. **Port:** add or extend a port in `rte/ports.ts`, then implement it in `bsw/` (and in `bsw/offline.ts`).
4. **Hook:** add an RTE hook if the UI needs state.
5. **UI:** build the component in `swc/ui/` using the hook or `useRte()`.
6. **Check:** `npm run lint:arch && npm test && npx tsc -b`, and `supabase/tests/run.sh` for database changes.
