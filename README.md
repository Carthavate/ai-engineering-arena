## Our story

In October 2026, [Wadi](https://github.com/TWadi) and [Ghassen](https://github.com/GhassenJamoussi99) decided to stop *talking* about learning AI engineering and actually do it, together. We set ourselves a 40-week path, from Python foundations all the way to shipping production LLM apps and agents.

We know how self-study usually goes: a strong first week, then life gets in the way. So we made it a game. Every lecture we finish earns XP. Quizzes have to be passed before a lecture counts. You can challenge your friend to a live quiz duel the moment you both finish a video. Then we kept adding things: code races, a Python lab in the browser, tokenizers, a tiny LLM running locally...

What started as a progress tracker turned into a small learning platform. This repo is both: **our actual learning journey** (notes, notebooks and projects for every phase) and **the arena we built around it**. We're sharing it in case it helps someone else learn with a friend, and because building it taught us almost as much as the courses did.

Friends are welcome to join: sign in with GitHub, and one of us lets you in.

## What's inside the arena

### Level up together
- **XP, levels and titles**, from *Prompt Padawan* to *Lab Legend*.
- **Badges and streaks**: hat tricks, perfect quizzes, phase finishers.
- **A live leaderboard.**
- **Activity feed** so you see the moment your friend finishes something (and feel the pressure).
- **Profiles** with an XP-over-time chart and **share cards** you can post when you level up.

### Learn, then prove it
- **The roadmap:** a RAG warm-up course, then 8 phases over 40 weeks, each with lectures, reading and a project to ship.
- **Quizzes for every lecture**, drawn from our own question bank and graded on the server (no peeking at answers).
- **A lecture only counts once you pass its quiz** (4/5 or better). Passing ticks it for you.
- **The lesson panel:** click any lesson to study it without leaving the page. Watch the video right there (privacy-friendly YouTube embed that loads only when you press play), read our lecture notes, take the quiz or start a duel, ask questions answered only from that lecture and your notes on it, keep private autosaved notes, and see which friends finished it. Every lesson has its own link, e.g. `#/lesson/rag-12`.

### Compete
- **Live quiz duels:** challenge a friend, they get a notification, and once they accept you both get the same 5 questions on a 2-minute clock. Best score wins, ties go to the faster player. A duel also counts as your quiz.
- **Code races:** a random coding challenge, revealed to both of you at the same moment. First to pass every test wins, then you compare each other's code.

### The Lab: hands-on, all in the browser, all free
![The Lab](docs/lab.png)

- **Coding challenges** (cosine similarity, chunking, BM25, reciprocal rank fusion, MMR…), graded instantly by real Python running in your browser ([Pyodide](https://pyodide.org)).
- **Python scratchpad:** a mini notebook with numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn.
- **Embeddings & RAG:**
  - Embed sentences and see them on a 2D map.
  - Chunk a document and retrieve the chunks that match a question.
  - Watch **a small LLM running on your own GPU** write the answer from those chunks ([transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js)).
- **Tokenizers:** see how GPT-4o, GPT-2, BERT, T5 and others chop up the same text.
- **Ask the course:** a chatbot that answers from our own notes on every RAG lecture and from your private notes (Notion export, pasted text, or what you wrote in a lesson panel). It shows the whole pipeline it ran: BM25 keyword search, embedding search, reciprocal rank fusion, the prompt, and citations. That's the RAG course, running in your browser.

## The learning path

| # | Phase | Weeks | What we ship |
|---|-------|-------|--------------|
| – | [RAG warm-up course](rag-course/) | before week 1 | Notes and quizzes on 17 videos |
| 0 | [Setup](00-setup/) | 1 | Repo live, first reviewed PRs |
| 1 | [Foundations](01-foundations/) | 2–5 | Tested Python CLI + analysis notebook |
| 2 | [Classical ML](02-classical-ml/) | 6–10 | Kaggle submission + model comparison |
| 3 | [Deep learning](03-deep-learning/) | 11–17 | A tiny GPT trained on our own corpus |
| 4 | [LLM apps](04-llm-apps/) | 18–24 | RAG app over our lecture PDFs + evals |
| 5 | [Agents & MCP](05-agents-mcp/) | 25–29 | An agent using our own MCP server |
| 6 | [Production](06-production/) | 30–34 | Deployed app with CI evals and cost dashboard |
| 7 | [Capstone](07-capstone/) | 35–40 | Public capstone, demo and write-up |

## Built with (and 100% free to run)

- **Site:** React + TypeScript + Vite, hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **Backend:** Supabase.
  - Postgres with row-level security.
  - Realtime for duels and the live feed.
  - GitHub sign-in.
  - Quizzes, duels and races are graded and decided in the database, so nobody can fake a score.
- **In-browser AI and Python:**
  - Pyodide for Python.
  - transformers.js for embeddings, tokenizers and a local Qwen2.5 LLM.
  - No paid APIs, no API keys.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions runs:
  - the Python tests;
  - a check of every coding challenge against its reference solution;
  - the architecture rules;
  - the site's tests and build;
  - a replay of every database migration on a fresh Postgres, followed by the SQL test suite.

```

The frontend follows an AUTOSAR-style layering:
- Application components never touch the database or workers directly; they go through typed ports in the RTE.
- CI fails the build on any layer violation.

Details are in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Run it yourself

Learning environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TWadi/ai-engineering-arena.git
cd ai-engineering-arena
uv sync                      # creates .venv and installs everything
cp .env.example .env         # then fill in your own keys
uv run python 00-setup/check_env.py
uv run pytest
```

The website (see [site/README.md](site/README.md) for connecting your own Supabase project):

```bash
cd site
npm ci
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:5173/ai-engineering-arena/
```
